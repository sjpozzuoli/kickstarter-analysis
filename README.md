# Analyzing the Outcomes of Kickstarter Campaigns

##  This data analysis was completed in order to help our client, Louise, create a Kickstarter campaign. We will use historical data on Kickstarter to compare the success rate of plays launched by date and funding goal.

### The purpose of this project is to help Louise determine when she should launch her project and how much her goal should be on Kickstarter.

## Analysis and Challenges

### While comparing the data based on Launch date, we can immediately see that the most successful campaigns begin in the late spring to early summer months, with 111 successful campaigns beginning in May, 100 in June and 87 in July.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- Limiatations of the Dataset
  * We are comparing the entire theater category by launch date and only the subcategory of plays by goal amounts. There could be some outlier data in the theater category that is not specifically related to Louise wanting to create a goal for a play.  

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
