# Analyzing the Outcomes of Kickstarter Campaigns

###  This data analysis was completed in order to help our client, Louise, create a Kickstarter campaign. We will use historical data on Kickstarter to compare the success rate by date and funding goal.

### The purpose of this project is to help Louise determine when she should launch her project and how much her goal should be on Kickstarter.

## Analysis and Challenges

#### Comparing the data based on Launch date, we can immediately see that the most successful campaigns begin in the late spring to early summer months, with 111 successful campaigns beginning in May, 100 in June and 87 in July.

#### Comparing the data based on goal amounts, we see that the most success is in campaigns that have a smaller goal. The large majority of the data is contained within these lower goal amounts, but their success percentage is also the highest.

## Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

#### Although I did not face any specific Challenges, there are some that I could foresee one having when perfroming an analysis like this.
1. The limited amount of data for the specific type of project we created this for could ultimately lead to some inaccuracies. The conclusions could be different if the data was more robust.
2. Understanding the most optimal way to represent the recommendation is something that takes experience and as I grow in this program, I believe it will be easier to express thoughts based on data.

## Results

1. Two conclusions of Outcomes based on Launch Date
  * May and June are the most successful months to launch a campaign based both on number and percentage. 
  * The only month where there is less than 50% of campaigns that are successful is December. 

2. Conslusion of Outcomes based on Goals
  * The smaller the goal, the better chance the Kickstarter has to be a success. If the goal is kept to $4999 and under, the chance of success is 73%.

3. Limitations of the Dataset
  * We are comparing the entire theater category by launch date and only the subcategory of plays by goal amounts. There could be some outlier data in the theater category that is not specifically related to Louise wanting to create a goal for a play.  
  * I would like to drill down further into the most successful goal amounts to create Interquartile statistics to determine the most optimal goal range for Louise to achieve her goal.
  * The dataset covers a span of 9 years. The data may be more indicative and show a negative or positive trend if examined more closely year over year. This could ultimately show Louise whether Play campaigns have been more successful recently, or if there is a downward trend in the data.

4. What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
  * I would like to create a table showing the year over year success rate of campaign goals to show if there is a positive trend in the rate of goals being met.
  * A box and whisker chart could be created to show the Interquartile ranges within the most successful goal amounts. This could help Louise to pinpoint the most optimal goal amount.
